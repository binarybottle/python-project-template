This is a template repository. Below is a checklist of things you should do to use it:

1. Rewrite this `README` file.
2. Update the pre-commit versions in `.pre-commit-config.yaml`.
3. Install the `pre-commit` hooks.
4. Update the `LICENSE` file to your desired license and set the year.
5. Replace "ENTER_YOUR_EMAIL_ADDRESS" in `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`
6. Remove the placeholder src and test files, these are there merely to show how the CI works.
7. Update `pyproject.toml`
8. Update the name of `src/APP_NAME`
